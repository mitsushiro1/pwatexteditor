## Description

I was motivated to learn progressive web applications due to how it would enrich my understanding of react
I built this project because I wanted to prove myself that I can make progressive web applications, although not completely since I was using a clone of a repo.
It makes a web application that works offline and can be downloaded as an app
I learned how progressive web applications and how it runs is essential to understanding how react works.

## Installation

clone the repo, npm i.

## Usage

npm start and go into the localhost:3000 I believe, or just go into my heroku app through the web.
